## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd even-chat-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables** (Optional but good practice):
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. If your Genkit configuration (e.g., for Google AI) requires API keys or specific project IDs not hardcoded, you would add them here. For the current setup with `@genkit-ai/googleai`, ensure your environment is authenticated with Google Cloud if you are using models that require it.
    Example `.env` content (if needed by your specific Google AI setup):
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
    ```
    *Note: The current `src/ai/genkit.ts` initializes `googleAI()` without explicit API key parameters, relying on Application Default Credentials or other environment-based authentication methods supported by Google Cloud client libraries.*

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Next.js development server**:
    This will run the main application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit Inspector (in a separate terminal)**:
    This tool allows you to inspect and test your Genkit flows.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, to watch for changes and automatically restart:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    The Genkit Inspector will typically be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
